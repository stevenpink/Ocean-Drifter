conductivity.py reads data from an Atlas Scientific conductivity probe and writes it to a file.

tempcond.py reads the air and water temperature from a pair of DS18B20 temperature probes, reads the conductivity value from the file, and pushes the data to an AssetLink satellite transponder at a regular interval.
